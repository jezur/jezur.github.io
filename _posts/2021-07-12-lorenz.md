In case you liked the attractor in my [*About Me*]({% link about.markdown %}) page,
this code will generate the same plot. We will be using only the libraries 
**numpy**, **matplotlib** and **scipy** in Python, but **Plots** and 
**Differential Equations** in Julia. I learned these skills thanks to
this [cool article by Jake VanderPlas](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/02/16/animating-the-lorentz-system-in-3d/).
I am interested in exploring many chaotic systems, so this post will try to
address some other cool attractors. All examples here are written in Python.
The Julia code will be available at the end of each section.
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

# The Lorenz Attractor
![Lorenz Attractor](/assets/img/lorenz_attractor_crop.png)

This one is so cool that does not need introduction, son lets get coding. 
Now we declare a function to compute de Lorenz system of differential equations.
The parameters $$\sigma$$, $\beta$ and $\rho$ are given directly. 
The function is designed to input a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and return the 
derivatives of each variable. 
```python
def lorenz(state, t, sigma=10.0, beta=8.0/3.0, rho=28.0):
    x, y, z = state     
    dx = sigma * (y - x)
    dy = x * (rho - z) - y
    dz = x * y - beta * z
    return [dx, dy, dz]
```

We are going to solve the Lorenz system for 9 initial conditions. We want the 
butterfly shape to have many colors, and that is why we use one color for each 
solution curve. All initial conditions will be random numbers between -15 and 15. We 
use a seed for the **np.random.random** function so the graphics are the same 
allways. The simulation time will be of 20 units of time, using 8000 points.
Solutions to Lorenz are stored in a three dimensional array.
We use a list comprehention to avoid excesive notation.
```python
np.random.seed(10)   # Try these, they are very cool: 6, 7, 10*, 15
N   = 9
x0  = -15 + 30 * np.random.random((N, 3))
t   = np.linspace(0, 20, 8000)
xt  = np.asarray([odeint(lorenz, i, t) for i in x0])
```

Results will be ploted in a 3D projection using **matplotlib**. The figure 
object contains one **matplotlib.axis**. All 9 solution curves 
will be on the same phase space. We turn off the axis so we only wet the
interesting part of the plot. We define the limits of the plot too.
```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))
ax  = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection='3d')
ax.axis('off')
ax.set_xlim((-25, 25))
ax.set_ylim((-35, 35))
ax.set_zlim((5, 55))
```

All collors supported by matplotlib 
[can be found here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html).
Those used for our plot are in the *colors* list. 
Using a for loop we plot all sets of points in the solution array. We pick 
the colors for each curve in order. Finally, we set the angles at which
we see the 3D plot using the **ax.view_init** function. Then we save a 
transparent image so it can fit on any backgroud.
```python
colors = ['darkslategray', 'slateblue', 'blue', 'navy', 'black', 'gray',
          'silver','royalblue','gainsboro']

for i in range(N):
    ax.plot3D(xt[i,:,0], xt[i,:,1], xt[i,:,2], colors[i])

ax.view_init(-25, -40)
name = "lorenz_attractor.png"
plt.savefig(name, transparent=True, dpi=300, bbox_inches=0.0, pad_inches=0.0)
plt.show()
```
